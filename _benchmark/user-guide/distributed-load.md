# Running distributed load generation 


OpenSearch Benchmark loads always run on the same machine where the benchmark was started. However, you can use multiple load drivers to generate additional benchmarking testing loads, particularly for large clusters on multiple machines. This tutorial describes how to distribute benchmark loads across multiple machines in a single cluster.

## System architecture 

The following sample tutorial uses a three-node architecture, each generated in [Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_ql_doc_ec2):

- **Node 1**: Node 1 acts as the _coordinator node_ which enables distribution and communication between the other two nodes.
- **Node 2** and **Node 3**: The remaining nodes in the cluster are used to generate the load for the benchmark test.

OpenSearch Benchmark must be installed on all nodes. For installation instructions, see [Installing OpenSearch Benchmark]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/benchmark/user-guide/installing-benchmark/).

Make note of each nodes IP addresses. This tutorial uses the following IP addresses for each node:

**Node 1 - Coordinator node**: 192.0.1.0
**Node 2 - Worker node**: 198.52.100.0
**Node 3 - Worker node**: 198.53.100.0

## Step 1: Enabling each node for communication

Make sure to enable each node to communicate with each other. In the AWS Console:

1. Go to the EC2 host for the node.
2. Select **Security**, and then select the security group associated with the node. 
3. Use **Add inbound rules** to open traffic to the node, based on the Port Range and traffic type of your cluster.

## Step 2: Running daemon processes on each node

Start OpenSearch Benchmark on each node using the `--node-ip` to initialize OpenSearch Benchmark on the node itself, and then `--coordinator-ip` to connect each node to the Coordinator node.

For **Node 1**, the following command identifies the node as coordinator:

```
opensearch-benchmarkd start --node-ip=192.0.1.0 --coordinator-ip=192.0.1.0
```

The following commands enable **Node 2** and **Node 3** to listen to the coordinator node for instructions on how to generate loads:

**Node 2**

```
opensearch-benchmarkd start --node-ip=198.52.100.0 --coordinator-ip=192.0.1.0
```

**Node 3**

```
opensearch-benchmarkd start --node-ip=198.53.100.0 --coordinator-ip=192.0.1.0
```

With OpenSearch Benchmark running on all three nodes and the worker nodes set to listen to the coordinator node, you can now run the Benchmark test.

## Step 3: Running the benchmark test

On **Node 1**, run a benchmark test with the `worker-ips` set to the IP addresses for your worker nodes, as shown in the following example:

```
opensearch-benchmark execute_test --pipeline=benchmark-only --workload=eventdata --worker-ips=198.52.100.0,198.53.100.0 --target-hosts=<DOMAIN_ENDPOINT> --client-options=<STANDARD_CLIENT_OPTIONS> --kill-running-processes
```

After the test runs, the logs generated by the test appear on your worker nodes.
